# codesmith-solo-project

A weekly production tracker tool for your Lost Ark roster.

Stretch Goals:

- [ ] Allow for you to mark a character as rested-only and update the production accordingly .
- [ ] Take into account two ebony cube tickets per week (maybe also allow you to mark whether you are doing them )
- [ ] Add user authentication to make roster showing user specific ; references to characters will need to be stored in a user's roster array in database.
